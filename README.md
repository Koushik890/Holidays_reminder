# Holidays_reminder

It is a python script which shows you a holiday in a particular year, and it will show you all the holidays(limited to UK) in the list. And then asks you to choose a holiday date you like to get reminded for. Then it asks for your email to send you reminder and after that it will send email to you before 2 days.
